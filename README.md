# cs303_project_mac

Project made by: Samantha Gonzales, Tom Steinman, and Seth Emery

The build-Desktop-Arm ... file is a .zip file that when unzipped has the mac executable file to run the program (project303.app).

The source-code_mac folder has all the sources and files that were in the project when I was building it on QT.
